## Concept of mutual friendship

> A mutual friend is an individual who has established a friendship with two people. When those two people meet, they learn that they share the same friend; that friend they have in common is their mutual friend. If the two people become friends, a circle of friendship develops between the mutual friend and the other individuals. Mutual friendships are commonplace in schools, where kids are introduced to each other by a mutual friend. Adults often meet other people in the workplace, bars, restaurants and other social settings due to a mutual friend introducing them.
